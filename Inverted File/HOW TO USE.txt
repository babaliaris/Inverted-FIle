1) The main.py is the user interface.

2) The Source_Files folder contains all the classes which constructs the program.

3) The Files Input folder is where the ".txt" files must be. The program will search for text files in there!!!
   Make sure that the filenames have 8 characters max (without counting the extension).


How to run the program:
-----------------------

    Run main.py using python 3! 

    Do NOT use python 2, this is very important (Better use the latest version of python)!!!
